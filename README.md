# Internship-Assignment-for-Computer-Vision

The objective of this assignment is to develop a solution using image processing techniques
to partially de-annotate an image, given an original image and a fully annotated image. The
solution should be able to de-annotate the image partially without re-annotating the original
image. The assignment will also provide a set of sample images containing original, fully
annotated, and partially annotated images for testing and evaluation purposes.The solution
should be able to identify and remove specific annotations from the fully annotated image
while preserving the underlying information of the original image. The partially de-annotated
image should not contain any unwanted annotations or distortions that may affect its
interpretation. Additionally, the solution should be able to generalize to different types of
images and annotations, and should be efficient and scalable for processing large datasets.
